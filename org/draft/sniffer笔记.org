* WireShark

** 可以使用WireShark完成的任务列表
   - Find the top talkers on the network
   - Identify the protocols and applications in use
   - Determine the average packets per second rate and bytes per
     second rate of an application or all network traffic on a link
   - List all hosts communicating
   - Learn the packet lengths used by a data transfer application
   - Recognize the most common connection problems
   - Spot delays between client requests due to slow processing
   - Locate misconfigured hosts
   - Detect network or host congestion that is slowing down file
     transfers
   - Identify asynchronous traffic prioritization
   - Graph HTTP flows to examine website referrals rates
   - Identify unusual scanning traffic on the network
   - Quickly identify HTTP error responses indicating client and
     server problems
   - Quickly identify VoIP error responses indicating client, server
     or global errors
   - Build graphs to compare traffic behavior
   - Graph application throughput and compare to overall link traffic
     seen
   - Identify applications that do not encrypt traffic
   - Play back VoIP conversations to hear the effects of various
     network problems on network traffic
   - Perform passive operating system and application use detection
   - Spot unusual protocols and unrecognized port number usage on the
     network
   - Examine the startup process of hosts and applications on the
     network
   - Identify average and unacceptable service response times (SRT)
   - Graph intervals of periodic packet generation applications or
     protocols

** Identify Network Problems
   
*** slow network communications
    Slow network performance can be due to high latency, access
    errors, excessive number of packets required to obtain data or a
    number of other causes. 

    When poor performance is due to *delays* in the communications, look
    for /large gaps in time/ between a request and acknowledgement, an
    acknowledgement and a response, etc.
